I developed this website using the [hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/), which I highly recommend for static site generation, especially if you enjoy working with Markdown. 

# Theming

The theming is based off the lovely [monochrome theme](go.io/themes/hugo-theme-monochrome/) by You-Kai Zheng, though I've added my own CSS and shortcodes. Icon glyphs have been taken from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons), though I think both of these are merged in the Nerd Fonts project, which I may switch to given I use it extensively with my own Linux theming.

# Source code

Source code for this site is available [on github](https://github.com/shervinsahba/hugo-sherv).
